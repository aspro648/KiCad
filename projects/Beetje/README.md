Beetje Bloks
----------------

What if breakout boards had a common footprint? You could design, build, and program larger projects in functional blocks and then synthesize the final project out of tested and characterized subsystems. 

Beetja Bloks are a test of that concept. Since I sell a disproportionate number of kits to the Netherlands, I’m going to call this a Beetje Blok, which translates from Dutch to “bit block”.  We are going to build things bit-by-bit. I’m not sure how to pronounce it.  Let’s say it “Beet-Cha”, as in, “I betcha can’t design a one-inch square dev board”.  I've written a lot more words about concept and execution on [Hack-A-Day](https://hackaday.io/project/160638-beetja-bloks).

The following Bloks have been designed / tested, with BOMs and particulars in their respective folders:
